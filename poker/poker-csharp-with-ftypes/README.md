# poker-csharp-with-ftypes

My F# Poker scoring solution, ported to C# 9.0 preview but using F# Records, F# Discriminated Unions, and F# List.

It's not bad only 40 lines longer with the same logic. Probably would have been way worse without the F# Types.

static local methods are a super nice feature, and I used them to simulate F# active patterns.
